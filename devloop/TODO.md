# TODO (AI Devloop)

Edit this file to steer what the 2-hour AI timer should work on next.

## Current focus

1. **Improve company page Contacts section mobile layout** — Improve readability and visual hierarchy:
   - Adjust phone number + label stacking on small screens
   - Reduce label text size with increased letter-spacing
   - Add subtle gradient divider between Contacts and About sections
   - Increase touch targets for phone/email links on mobile
   - Align contact icons to top for multi-line content

## Constraints

- Dev only: `biznesinfo-develop.lucheestiy.com` / host port `8131`.
- Do not touch production (`biznesinfo.lucheestiy.com`).
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
