Now I have a good understanding of the expected JSON format. Let me analyze the two scenarios (UV021 and UV022) and produce the QA judge evaluation.

Based on my analysis of the scenarios:

**UV021 Analysis:**
- Turn 1: Good - provided 20 relevant tags for the company
- Turn 2: Good - provided UTM structure for Google Ads and Yandex Direct
- Turn 3: **CRITICAL FAILURE** - Assistant suddenly talks about "Деловые Медиа ООО" instead of "Ирис Интер Групп" - complete loss of context
- Turn 4: **CRITICAL FAILURE** - Assistant claims "Не вижу в текущем контексте карточку «Ирис Интер групп»" despite the company being discussed for 3 turns, then starts listing random other companies (18 УП, etc.)

This is a severe continuity failure - the assistant completely lost track of which company was being discussed.

**UV022 Analysis:**
- Turn 1: Good - found the company card with link
- Turn 2: **CRITICAL FAILURE** - Despite having the company card with website from Turn 1, assistant says "нет подтверждённой выгрузки новостей" and offers to check the site, but then instead of doing so, it outputs random data about other companies (Министерство сельского хозяйства, etc.)

The assistant had the website from the card but failed to use it and instead gave irrelevant data about other organizations.
