I see that in the run data from `run-2026-02-12T03-49-41-634Z-2676669-0z2j7.json`, scenarios S016-S020 all failed with HTTP 502 errors, meaning the assistant responses are not available from that run.

Based on the request provided by the user, the assistant responses are empty (""), which means I need to evaluate based on the scenario definitions and typical expected behavior. However, since the request explicitly asks me to evaluate the usefulness as a real frustrated business user, and the assistant responses are empty in the provided data, I should note that these scenarios represent single-turn conversations where the assistant did not provide any response.

Given that the assistant responses are empty (which indicates a system failure or incomplete data), I will provide a QA judge evaluation noting this critical issue. Since the request provides the schema and expected output format, I'll produce the JSON evaluation:
