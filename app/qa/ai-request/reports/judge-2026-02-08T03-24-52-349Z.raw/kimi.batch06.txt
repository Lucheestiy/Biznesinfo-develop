Based on my review of previous QA judge results to ensure consistency, here is my evaluation for scenarios UXA011-UXA015:

```json

      "wouldContinue": true,
      "feltGenericFallback": false,
      "continuityScore": 3,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Asked clarifying questions to narrow down search (product, region, volume)",
        "Provided concrete search keywords for finding manufacturers ('производитель', 'завод', 'собственное производство')",
        "Gave practical criteria for verifying manufacturers in company cards"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Did not provide any concrete manufacturer candidates immediately",
        "No indication of how quickly actual results can be delivered after clarification"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear explanation of how to identify manufacturers vs intermediaries",
        "Specific verification checklist for production capabilities",
        "Maintained focus on user's core need (finding manufacturers)"
      ],
      "nextUserProbe": "Найди производителей пластиковых контейнеров в Минске, объем 1000 шт/мес"

      "userSatisfaction": 0.45,
      "wouldContinue": false,
      "feltGenericFallback": true,
      "continuityScore": 2,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Generic response asking for context instead of showing how to filter existing results",
        "Only mentioned checking 'Сайт' field and 'если доступно' filter — no concrete action",
        "Critical penalty: user gave a clear filter constraint, but assistant fell back to generic advice"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Failed to demonstrate the filter in action or show example results with websites",
        "Response structure prioritizes asking questions over delivering value",
        "No indication of whether 'website' filter actually exists in the interface"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Acknowledged the filter requirement correctly",
        "Mentioned specific field to check ('Сайт')",
        "Offered to filter existing list if user has one"
      ],

      "wouldContinue": false,
      "feltGenericFallback": true,
      "continuityScore": 1,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Complete response failure — garbled template output with placeholders instead of actual answer",
        "Response appears to be a broken email/WhatsApp template mix with {city}, {qty}, {spec} placeholders",
        "No actual answer to the user's request about filtering by email"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Critical quality failure: template system leaked into response with unfilled variables",
        "Zero useful information provided about email filtering",
        "Response is completely unusable for the user's task",
        "No indication whether email filter exists or how to apply it"
      ],

      "feltGenericFallback": false,
      "continuityScore": 3,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Provided concrete search keywords for B2B companies ('юрлица', 'безнал', 'НДС', 'счёт-фактура')",
        "Acknowledged the filter need and offered to narrow further with clarifying questions",
        "Keywords are actionable and relevant to finding companies working with legal entities"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Did not demonstrate the filter in action or show example companies",
        "No confirmation whether 'works with legal entities' is an actual filter in the interface",
        "Response prioritizes asking questions over showing results"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Specific B2B-oriented keywords provided",
        "Acknowledged additional constraints that might matter (НДС, отсрочка, доставка)",
        "Keywords cover both search and verification aspects"
      ],
      "nextUserProbe": "Покажи конкретно IT-компании в Минске, которые работают с юрлицами и выставляют НДС"

        "Turn 1: Asked for company name/ID to locate the specific reception number",
        "Correctly indicated data source (Biznesinfo catalog cards)",
        "Honest about limitation — will report as unknown if not in card"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Did not offer to show example of where reception number appears in a card",
        "No proactive help like 'Here is how to find it yourself'",
        "Response is purely reactive — waits for user input"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear about data boundaries and source",
        "Honest about limitations upfront",
        "Specific request for identifying information (name, ID, link)"
      ],
