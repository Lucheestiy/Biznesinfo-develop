      "wouldContinue": true,
      "feltGenericFallback": false,
      "continuityScore": 4,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Clear request for specific info (link/ID, new address, phone) — actionable and practical",
        "Turn 2: Correctly explained that new UNP = new company, suggested creating new card and updating/closing old one",
        "Turn 3: Answered moderation timing question with concrete steps via /add-company page"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3 response appears slightly off-topic — user asked about moderation time, but assistant gave general add-company instructions without specifying actual timing",
        "No specific timeframe given for moderation (hours/days)"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent continuity: maintained 'update company data' context across all turns",
        "Turn 2 correctly handled complex legal scenario (UNP change = new entity)",
        "Referenced official registry (egr.gov.by) for verification",
        "Honest about limitations when specific company not identified"
      ],

      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Provided only 1 relevant candidate (Белпожохрансервис) for video surveillance in Minsk",
        "Turn 3: Delivered comprehensive checklist of questions for contractor calls"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 2: Generic fallback — instead of filtering concrete candidates, gave search rubric advice ('ищите в рубриках типа...')",
        "Turn 2 completely failed to narrow to companies working with legal entities despite user explicitly requesting this filter",
        "No actual companies provided in Turn 2 — just generic category suggestions",
        "Critical penalty: after user gave concrete constraints (юрлица, проект+монтаж), assistant dropped to generic search instructions instead of concrete progress"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Turn 1 correctly identified Белпожохрансервис as relevant candidate",
        "Turn 3 checklist is comprehensive and procurement-focused (13 questions covering project, equipment, warranties, maintenance)",
        "Maintained context (Минск, видеонаблюдение, юрлица) in Turn 3"

      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Only 3 confirmed candidates instead of requested top-10, honestly indicated limited matches",
        "Turn 2: Correctly filtered to 2 companies with post-renovation cleaning (БэстКлининг, БК-ИНВЕСТ)"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Failed to answer why rating is high or provide reviews — instead asked user to clarify which company (despite context from Turn 2)",
        "Turn 3 then provided generic ranking without explaining rating basis",
        "No actual rating scores or review content provided in any turn",
        "User asked about ratings/reviews specifically — assistant never accessed or provided this data"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest about limited catalog matches instead of making up companies",

        "Turn 3: Delivered comprehensive mediakit checklist covering company info, UTP, visuals, and texts"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 1: Suggested clarifying formats with manager instead of providing complete specs directly",
        "No specific pricing or audience metrics provided",
        "Turn 3 checklist cut off mid-sentence ('Список…')"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent continuity: maintained 'advertising/promotion' context across all turns",
        "Turn 1 formats are specific and actionable (banners, highlighting, extended card)",

      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Complete context break — provided irrelevant companies (Ресторан ДУБРОВЪ, Наш Край газета) that have nothing to do with coffee shop supplies",
        "Critical continuity failure: user asked for Minsk suppliers of cups, syrups, coffee — got a restaurant and a newspaper",
        "No actual suppliers of coffee, cups, or syrups provided in any turn",
        "Generic fallback throughout: Turn 1 gave rubrics, Turn 2 gave checklist, Turn 3 gave random unrelated companies"
      ],
      "strengths": [
