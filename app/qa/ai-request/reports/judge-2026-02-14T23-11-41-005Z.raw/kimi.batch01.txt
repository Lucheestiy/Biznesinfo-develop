The file already contains the QA judge evaluation results for scenarios UV001-UV005. Let me verify the content matches the expected schema and provide a summary of the results.

Looking at the JSON file, I can see it contains a complete evaluation with:

1. **Metadata**: Judge name, task description, rubric with 0-5 scale, dimensions, and instructions
2. **Expected Scenario IDs**: UV001, UV002, UV003, UV004, UV005
3. **Ratings array** with 5 evaluations:

| Scenario | Usefulness | Verdict | Confidence | User Satisfaction | Would Continue | Felt Generic Fallback | Continuity Score |
|----------|------------|---------|------------|-------------------|----------------|----------------------|------------------|
| UV001 | 2 | not_useful | 0.85 | 0.35 | false | true | 2 |
| UV002 | 4 | useful | 0.80 | 0.70 | true | false | 4 |
| UV003 | 3 | useful | 0.75 | 0.55 | true | false | 4 |
| UV004 | 3 | useful | 0.80 | 0.60 | true | true | 3 |
| UV005 | 1 | not_useful | 0.90 | 0.20 | false | true | 1 |

**Summary of findings:**

- **UV001 (Shoe manufacturers in Minsk)**: Failed to provide concrete manufacturers, gave generic search instructions instead of actual company names. Only the contact template in Turn 4 was useful.

- **UV002 (Flour mills)**: Good performance - provided specific factories, maintained continuity with quality criteria, and gave a comprehensive document checklist. Minor issue with Turn 3 being too brief.

- **UV003 (Nearby dining → B2B pivot)**: Successfully handled consumer-to-business transition, provided practical search queries and outreach templates. Lacked specific restaurant recommendations.

- **UV004 (Juice extractors OEM/ODM)**: Started well with specific candidates and OEM analysis, but Turn 3 was a generic fallback without reliability/service comparison. RFQ template was excellent.

- **UV005 (Food exporters)**: Critical failure - after requesting dairy/confectionery exporters for EAEU/CIS markets, the assistant provided completely irrelevant agricultural farms instead of dairy/confectionery factories.

The file appears to be complete and properly formatted according to the required JSON schema.
