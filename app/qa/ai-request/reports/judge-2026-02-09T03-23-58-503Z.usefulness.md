### Top Issues (gemini)

- none

### Worst Scenarios (gemini)

- GA001: usefulness 5/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=100% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=5/5
  reason: Assistant successfully handled ambiguous city request by providing options and clear next steps.
  reason: Adapted effectively to user's clarification, adjusting strategy and candidate evaluation.
- GA002: usefulness 5/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=100% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=5/5
  reason: Assistant successfully adapted to a refined geographical scope.
  reason: Logically re-evaluated previous candidates based on new constraints.

## kimi

- Average usefulness: 4/5
- Useful (>=3): 2/2 (100.0%)
- Zero-usefulness: 0
- Real-user satisfaction: 79.0%
- Would continue rate: 100.0%
- Generic fallback rate: 0.0%
- Continuity score avg: 4.5/5

### Top Issues (kimi)

- turn 2 has garbled text at the end ('из доступных релевантных карточек прямо сейчас: причина:...') — company names are missing — 1
- no actual minsk candidates provided despite user prioritizing minsk as base — 1
- turn 2: did not provide new candidates from actual minsk region — only re-evaluated existing ones — 1
- амифрут still listed as 'условно' despite user explicitly excluding minsk city — 1

### Worst Scenarios (kimi)

- GA001: usefulness 4/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=78% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=4/5
  reason: Turn 1: Provided 2 concrete candidates with direct links and clear reasoning for exclusion of irrelevant match (ДАЛМИО)
  reason: Turn 2: Correctly pivoted strategy to 'base in Minsk, reserve in Brest' maintaining both geo options
  issue: Turn 2 has garbled text at the end ('Из доступных релевантных карточек прямо сейчас: Причина:...') — company names are missing
  issue: No actual Minsk candidates provided despite user prioritizing Minsk as base
- GA002: usefulness 4/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=80% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=5/5
  reason: Turn 1: Provided 2 concrete candidates with specific relevance reasoning for onion wholesale
  reason: Turn 2: Correctly adjusted geo filter from 'city Minsk' to 'Minsk region (excluding city)'
  issue: Turn 2: Did not provide new candidates from actual Minsk region — only re-evaluated existing ones
  issue: Амифрут still listed as 'условно' despite user explicitly excluding Minsk city

## minimax

- Average usefulness: 2.5/5
- Useful (>=3): 1/2 (50.0%)
- Zero-usefulness: 0
- Real-user satisfaction: 37.5%
- Would continue rate: 50.0%
- Generic fallback rate: 100.0%
- Continuity score avg: 2.5/5

### Top Issues (minimax)

- broken promise: states candidates exist but provides zero company names — 1
- response appears truncated or incomplete — 1
- failed to provide any minsk supplier despite geographic clarification — 1
- geo confusion persists: minsk=base, brest=delivery, but assistant still centered on brest — 1
- penalty: after 'region not city' clarification, assistant falls back to same companies with 'check if they deliver' — 1
- no new minsk oblast candidates identified — should have searched regional suppliers — 1
- zhdanovichi is within minsk region — assistant should have confirmed this as primary candidate — 1
- generic fallback after concrete geographic constraint — 1

### Worst Scenarios (minimax)

- GA001: usefulness 2/5 (not_useful)
  userSatisfaction=30% continue=no genericFallback=yes continuity=2/5
  reason: Turn 1 provides 2 concrete Brest candidates with company names — decent start
  reason: Turn 2 claims candidates exist but never lists them after saying 'Из доступных релевантных карточек прямо сейчас'
  issue: Broken promise: states candidates exist but provides zero company names
  issue: Response appears truncated or incomplete
- GA002: usefulness 3/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=45% continue=yes genericFallback=yes continuity=3/5
  reason: Turn 1 provides 2 concrete onion suppliers in Minsk — Amifrut and Zhdanovichi
  reason: Turn 2 adjusts geographic filter to Minsk region as requested
  issue: Penalty: After 'region not city' clarification, assistant falls back to same companies with 'check if they deliver'
  issue: No new Minsk oblast candidates identified — should have searched regional suppliers
