I see there's already an evaluation file `qa_judge_uv001_005_kimi.json` with ratings. However, the user is asking me to evaluate these scenarios again. Let me provide a fresh evaluation based on the transcript data provided in the prompt.

        "Turn 1-3: Repeatedly claims no confirmed companies in catalog instead of providing actual manufacturers",
        "Turn 3: Critical failure - when asked for shortlist of 3-5 manufacturers, provides generic criteria instead of company names",
        "User gave concrete constraints (men's classic shoes, manufacturers only) but assistant fell back to methodology"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Generic fallback at turn 3 - provides 'criteria to check' instead of actual company shortlist",
