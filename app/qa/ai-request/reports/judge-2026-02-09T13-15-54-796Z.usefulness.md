### Top Issues (kimi)

- turn 3: generic fallback to rubric search suggestions after admitting no region candidates — acceptable given data limitation — 1
- turn 4 ranking includes minsk city suppliers despite user asking for minsk region — should have been clearer about geographic mismatch — 1
- turn 3: incomplete company name display — 'почему подходит:' appears without company name before it — 1
- turn 5: ranking criteria reference 'риск несоответствия задаче' without explaining what that risk is for each — 1
- turn 2 (switchback to auto parts): response is entirely generic rubric advice — no concrete auto parts suppliers given — 1
- turn 4: critical failure — instead of providing top-3 milk suppliers, gave broken template output with 'страница: —' placeholders and random text about 'фокус: стоп, теперь ищем автозапчасти' — 1
- turn 4 completely broke context — mixed up milk and auto parts queries, produced garbled output — 1
- never actually delivered top-3 for milk in brest despite user returning to topic twice — 1
- turn 5 questions are relevant but come too late — user already asked for top-3 twice — 1
- turn 4: company names missing before 'почему:' — appears as bullet points without headers — 1
