The evaluation has already been completed in the file `qa_judge_uv001_005.json`. The results show:

**Summary:**

| Scenario | Usefulness | Verdict | Would Continue | Felt Generic Fallback |
|----------|-----------|---------|----------------|----------------------|
| UV001 | 2 | not_useful | false | true |
| UV002 | 3 | useful | true | true |
| UV003 | 4 | useful | true | false |
| UV004 | 3 | useful | true | true |
| UV005 | 3 | useful | true | true |

**Key Findings:**

1. **UV001 (Shoe manufacturers in Minsk)** - The assistant failed to provide concrete company names when explicitly asked for a shortlist of 3-5 manufacturers, falling back to generic criteria instead. This was a critical failure.

2. **UV002 (Flour mills)** - Good technical depth on quality parameters but again no concrete company names in the shortlist.

3. **UV003 (Nearby restaurants → B2B)** - Best performing scenario. Successfully pivoted from consumer to B2B context, provided practical search variations, and delivered usable message templates. Minor issue with irrelevant companies listed at the end.

4. **UV004 (Juicer manufacturers)** - Good OEM/ODM guidance and comprehensive RFQ template, but no concrete manufacturer names provided.

5. **UV005 (Food exporters)** - Good market segmentation and professional outreach templates, but again no specific company names in the shortlist.

**Common Pattern:** The assistant consistently fails to provide concrete company names when users ask for shortlists, falling back to generic "types of companies to look for" instead. This is penalized per the rubric's instruction to "Strongly penalize when assistant previously gave concrete candidates but later falls back to generic rubric advice after user clarification."
