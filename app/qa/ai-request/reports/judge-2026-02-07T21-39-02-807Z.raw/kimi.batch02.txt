I can see that this QA judge request has already been processed and the results are saved in `/home/mlweb/biznesinfo-develop.lucheestiy.com/qa_judge_ux107_109.json`. The file contains ratings for all 5 scenarios (D006-D010).

The results show:
- **D006** (вентиляция склад): usefulness 4, useful
- **D007** (сертификат соответствия): usefulness 2, not_useful - critical issue: never provided concrete certification bodies
- **D008** (уборка после ремонта): usefulness 4, useful - excellent continuity
- **D009** (коробки с логотипом): usefulness 3, useful - only 1 supplier found
- **D010** (добавить компанию): usefulness 3, useful - evaded direct answer in turns 1-2

The evaluation has already been completed and saved. Is there something specific you'd like me to do with these results, such as:
1. Generate a summary report?
2. Compare with previous evaluations?
3. Update or modify any ratings?
4. Export in a different format?
