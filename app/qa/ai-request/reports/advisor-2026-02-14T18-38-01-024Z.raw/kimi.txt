Based on my analysis of the evidence, I can see that:

1. **The immediate problem is a 502 Bad Gateway error** - The QA runner received a 502 from nginx, meaning the backend (Next.js app) is either not responding or crashing
2. **The app container just restarted** (2 minutes ago) - indicating a crash or restart loop
3. **Historical UV017 data shows usefulness=2** (not 0) when the service was working - meaning the scenario previously had partial success with continuity issues
4. **The AIAssistant.tsx component is just a form UI** - it doesn't contain the actual AI/chat logic that would handle the conversation

The critical issue is infrastructure-level (502 errors), not prompt-level. The app container is unstable.
