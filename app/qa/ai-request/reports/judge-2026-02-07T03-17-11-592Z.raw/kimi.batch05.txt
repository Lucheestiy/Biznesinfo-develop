Based on my analysis of the two scenarios (S009 and S010), here is the evaluation:

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "S009",
      "usefulness": 3,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 3 honestly admits only 2 relevant candidates exist instead of hallucinating a third",
        "Provides concrete contract checklist with actionable items (ТЗ, сроки, стоимость, гарантии)"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 2 fails to provide actual results for Девятовка district - only generic search instructions",
        "No verification that listed companies actually serve B2B clients or work by contract"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest about data limitations in Turn 3",
        "Contract checklist is practical and comprehensive for B2B sourcing"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S010",
      "usefulness": 4,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1 provides relevant printing companies with specific service mentions (каталоги, буклеты)",
        "Turn 3 delivers clear top-3 ranking with justification and practical color proof checklist"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 2 ignores Малиновка context - repeats same list without filtering by proximity"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Color proof checklist is industry-specific and actionable (тип пробы, стандарты, бумага, сроки)",
        "Maintains context continuity for тираж 5000 across all turns",
        "Asked relevant clarifying questions about format, paper, and deadlines"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
