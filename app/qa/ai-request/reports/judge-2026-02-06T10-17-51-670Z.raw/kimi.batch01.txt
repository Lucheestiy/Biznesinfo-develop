Looking at this request, I need to act as an external QA judge and evaluate the usefulness of AI assistant replies in the provided multi-turn business sourcing conversations. Let me analyze each scenario based on the rubric and return ONLY valid JSON.

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "S001",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Assistant ignores geo refinement (Сухарево) and keeps repeating same generic list",
        "Ranking includes irrelevant companies (АмикПласт for packaging, БВСпроджект for lingerie)",
        "No actual reasons provided for 'why' in top-3 request"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Complete failure to filter by district Сухарево",
        "Companies don't match product category (ПНД трубы)"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Provides company links and acknowledges data limitations"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S002",
      "usefulness": 3,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "reasons": [
        "Initial list contains somewhat relevant companies (БелСтройКомплект, Завод Энергооборудование)",
        "Ranking at turn 3 prioritizes more relevant companies",
        "Still ignores Советский район refinement"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "No response to 'Советский район' geo constraint",
        "Does not address certificate question in turn 3"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Better company relevance than S001",
        "Ranking order improved in final turn"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S003",
      "usefulness": 1,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 2 completely breaks - returns generic instructions instead of district filtering",
        "Turn 3 ranking is completely wrong (advertising agency, furniture store, car service for concrete request)",
        "No continuity with original concrete suppliers from turn 1"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Catastrophic context loss at turn 2",
        "Ranking returns completely unrelated companies",
        "Fails basic task of supplier shortlisting"
      ],
      "strengths": []
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S004",
      "usefulness": 1,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1 gives generic priority framework instead of actual company list",
        "Turn 2 breaks context and returns search instructions instead of filtering by Уручье",
        "Turn 3 repeats same generic framework without actual companies"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Never provides actual cleaning service companies",
        "Complete failure to handle geo refinement",
        "Generic filler response without actionable data"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Framework structure is logical (just not populated with data)"
      ]
    },
    {

      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasons": [
        "Initial list includes some auto-related companies but misses tire service specialization",
        "Ignores Каменная Горка location refinement",
        "Does not answer 'who to call first' question with actionable priority"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "No tire-specific companies in results",
        "Geo refinement ignored",
        "No practical prioritization guidance"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Companies are at least in automotive sector",
        "Maintains context better than S003/S004"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
