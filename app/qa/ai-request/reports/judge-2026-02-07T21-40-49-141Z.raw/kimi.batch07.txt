Based on the transcript for scenario D007, here is my evaluation:

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "D007",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "userSatisfaction": 0.35,
      "wouldContinue": false,
      "feltGenericFallback": true,
      "continuityScore": 1,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Lists irrelevant companies (Автоцентр, Алмаз-Люкс, Безопасный дом) that have nothing to do with certification services",
        "Turn 3: Despite user explicitly requesting 'план: куда идти и какие доки', assistant provides only generic rubric instructions instead of concrete certification bodies or labs in Belarus"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Generic fallback: After user clarified 'для продукции рб, быстро' and asked for specific plan, assistant still provides abstract instructions rather than actual certification organizations",
        "No concrete 'куда идти' — no specific company names, addresses, or contacts for certification bodies in Belarus",
        "Listed companies in Turn 1 are completely irrelevant to certification (auto parts, glass, security) — suggests poor search/index quality or hallucination"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Document checklist in Turn 3 is structurally correct and actionable",
        "Honest about needing product category to give specific guidance"
      ],
      "nextUserProbe": "дай конкретные организации по сертификации в минске с контактами"
    }
  ]
}
```
