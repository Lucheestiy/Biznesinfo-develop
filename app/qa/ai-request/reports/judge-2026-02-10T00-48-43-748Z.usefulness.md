### Top Issues (gemini)

- shortlist in turn 3 is largely empty, making it less immediately actionable for finding actual suppliers. — 1
- hallucination of company names in the shortlist (turn 3) that are completely irrelevant to the user's request. — 1
- lack of continuity when providing a shortlist after stating no relevant companies were found. — 1
- high penalty for providing a generic fallback ('5 вопросов для первого звонка') applied to irrelevant companies. — 1
- shortlist in turn 3 is not very practical, with only one company listed (an institute, not an exporter) and then many 'резервный слот' entries. — 1
- inclusion of completely irrelevant company in shortlist. — 1
- repeatedly provides irrelevant companies for a specific product search. — 1
- breakdown of context and relevance after the first turn. — 1

### Worst Scenarios (gemini)

- UV008: usefulness 0/5 (not_useful)
  userSatisfaction=0% continue=no genericFallback=yes continuity=0/5
  reason: Assistant provides completely irrelevant companies (cafes, packaging) for mini-tractors across multiple turns.
  reason: Attempts to justify irrelevant suggestions with vague reasoning ('срочные сроки').
  issue: Repeatedly provides irrelevant companies for a specific product search.
  issue: Breakdown of context and relevance after the first turn.
- UV004: usefulness 1/5 (not_useful)
  userSatisfaction=20% continue=no genericFallback=yes continuity=1/5
  reason: Assistant hallucinates the shortlist in turn 3 by listing companies it previously identified as irrelevant (furniture, tires, asphalt) to juicer manufacturing/OEM.
  reason: The inclusion of irrelevant companies severely damages trust and makes the shortlist completely unhelpful.
  issue: Hallucination of company names in the shortlist (turn 3) that are completely irrelevant to the user's request.
  issue: Lack of continuity when providing a shortlist after stating no relevant companies were found.
- UV007: usefulness 2/5 (not_useful)

  issue: Assistant re-suggested irrelevant companies that were explicitly told to be excluded, violating context continuity and trust.
- UV002: usefulness 3/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=70% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=4/5
  reason: Assistant provides excellent B2B criteria for quality (turn 2) and a comprehensive document checklist (turn 4).
  reason: Maintains context about Belarus and flour production.
  issue: Shortlist in turn 3 is largely empty, making it less immediately actionable for finding actual suppliers.
- UV005: usefulness 3/5 (useful)

  reason: Assistant provides very good search guidance for identifying exporters, including specific keywords, rubrics, and filtering criteria (turns 1 and 2).
