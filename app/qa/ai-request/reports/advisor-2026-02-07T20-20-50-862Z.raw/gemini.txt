  "executiveSummary": "The Biznesinfo AI assistant demonstrates strong performance across the reviewed \"Bank G: Errors and Stress Cases\" scenarios, achieving a 100% pass rate in strict checks and high usefulness scores from both Gemini and Kimi judges. The assistant effectively understands user intent, provides clear explanations, offers actionable advice, and accurately executes search queries with filters. No critical issues or low-usefulness responses were identified. The current state suggests a well-tuned system for these specific error-handling and diagnostic interactions. Improvements focus on enhancing user guidance and clarifying system actions, even in already successful interactions.",

Давайте проверим...' - 'Sometimes results are not found due to typos, overly specific/broad queries, or searching in the wrong category.
