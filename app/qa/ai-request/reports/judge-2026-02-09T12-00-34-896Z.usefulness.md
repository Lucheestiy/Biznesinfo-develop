### Top Issues (kimi)

- turn 3: slight fallback to generic advice about searching catalog when no minsk region candidates found — 1
- turn 4: included minsk city candidates in 'minsk region' shortlist despite user explicitly excluding city — 1
- turn 3: response is garbled/incomplete — missing actual brest candidate name and link — 1
- turn 4: generic ranking without proper context — candidates don't match user's constraints (терсет-вест is in brest but not clearly onion-focused) — 1
- turn 4: ranking appears to be auto-generated template with wrong focus (mentions 'brest' for all 3 including minsk region candidate) — 1
- turn 5: response mixes new checklist with repetition of old ranking — confusing formatting — 1
- turn 4: honest about having only 2 confirmed candidates instead of 3, but response format is garbled with template artifacts — 1
- turn 4: included confusing text about 'фокус: автозапчасти' when user already returned to milk topic — 1
- turn 3: complete failure — responded with instructions about adding a company to catalog instead of providing top-3 cable suppliers — 1
- turn 4: repeated same completely wrong response about adding company, ignoring 48-hour delivery constraint entirely — 1

### Worst Scenarios (minimax)

- MX004: usefulness 2/5 (not_useful)
  userSatisfaction=25% continue=no genericFallback=yes continuity=1/5
  reason: Complete context loss in turns 3-4 - assistant provides add-company instructions instead of supplier list
  reason: Turn 3 completely ignores request for top-3 with links, gives unrelated instructions
  issue: Turns 3-4 provide completely wrong content (add-company page instead of suppliers)
  issue: 48-hour delivery requirement completely ignored

  userSatisfaction=30% continue=no genericFallback=yes continuity=2/5
  reason: Critical content coherence failure in turns 4-5

  issue: Turn 4-5 content is malformed with repeated segments
  issue: Shortlist ranking is inconsistent between turns
- MX003: usefulness 2/5 (not_useful)

  issue: Turn 3 gives Brest companies (wrong geo) instead of maintaining Minsk focus from turn 2
  issue: Turn 3 questions are generic rubric without specific parameters
- MX001: usefulness 4/5 (useful)
  userSatisfaction=80% continue=yes genericFallback=no continuity=4/5
  reason: Good continuity throughout geo-clarifications (Brest → Minsk → Minsk Oblast)
