Looking at the TODO.md, I can see this is about evaluating the AI assistant for the Biznesinfo project. The user is asking me to act as an external QA judge to rate the usefulness of AI assistant replies in realistic multi-turn business sourcing conversations.

Let me analyze each scenario based on the provided rubric:

**S031 - RFQ: кабель ВВГнг**
- Turn 1: Good RFQ template with Subject/Body/WhatsApp format
- Turn 2: Successfully made it more polite and shorter as requested
- Turn 3: Successfully switched Body to English while keeping Subject in Russian
- All requirements met, good context continuity

**S032 - RFQ: ПНД трубы**
- Turn 1: Good template with placeholders
- Turn 2: Added emphasis on timing and certificates as requested
- Turn 3: The WhatsApp version was cut off mid-sentence ("условиями по…"), but the email body is complete
- Minor issue: Turn 3 WhatsApp is truncated

**S033 - RFQ: клининг офиса**
- Turn 1: Good template with placeholders
- Turn 2: Added stricter tone and SLA requirements as requested
- Turn 3: Added placeholders for schedule and penalties as requested
- All requirements met

**S034 - RFQ: SEO service**
- Turn 1: Good template in English
- Turn 2: Made it more formal but not too long as requested
- Turn 3: Added placeholders for KPI and timeline as requested
- All requirements met

**S035 - RFQ: охрана склада**
- Turn 1: Good template with comprehensive placeholders
- Turn 2: Added response time and reporting requirements block
- Turn 3: The user asked to shorten WhatsApp to 3-4 sentences, but the response shows the same long email body and the WhatsApp part is completely missing (truncated or not generated)
- Critical issue: Turn 3 didn't fulfill the request to shorten WhatsApp version
