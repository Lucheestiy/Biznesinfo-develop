Based on my analysis of the 5 multi-turn sourcing scenarios, here is the QA judgment:

        "Turn 3: After user clarified geography to 'Минская область без города Минска', assistant fell back to generic search advice instead of providing concrete candidates",
        "Critical continuity failure: The assistant kept flip-flopping between Брест and Минск, never respecting the Минская область constraint"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Geography confusion: Turn 4 shows companies from Брест when user asked for Минская область",
        "Generic fallback in Turn 3: 'делаем прозрачный fallback' instead of concrete suppliers",

        "Turn 3: Complete geography failure - user asked for 'Минская область' + 'поставка в Брест', but assistant returned companies from Брест (ТЕРСЕТ-ВЕСТ, Берестейское КФХ) that are mushroom/berry and agricultural companies, not onion suppliers",
        "Turn 4: Assistant admits only 1 relevant candidate (Алсэдо) which is actually a food ingredients company, not an onion supplier - then gives generic search advice",
        "Turn 5: Checklist is mixed with irrelevant ranking output, showing confusion in formatting"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Wrong product category in Turn 3: returned mushroom/berry and general agriculture companies for onion request",

        "Turn 5: Asked 2 precise clarification questions when data was insufficient - appropriate response"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3 response is somewhat generic (gives search instructions rather than just the 2 known candidates)",
        "Could have been more direct in Turn 3 - immediately provide the 2 known suppliers instead of search instructions"

        "Turn 4 completely lost geographic context and returned to a generic electrical equipment company in wrong city",

        "Wrong company type in Turn 4: ОБО БЕТТЕРМАНН is general electrical equipment, not cable supplier",
