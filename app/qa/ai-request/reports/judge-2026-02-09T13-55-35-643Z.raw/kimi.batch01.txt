The evaluation file `qa_judge_mx001_005.json` is already complete and valid. Here's a summary of my judgments:

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "summary": {
    "MX001": {"usefulness": 4, "verdict": "useful", "key_issue": "Turn 4 included Minsk city suppliers despite user asking for Minsk region"},
    "MX002": {"usefulness": 4, "verdict": "useful", "key_issue": "Turn 3 had incomplete company name display"},
    "MX003": {"usefulness": 2, "verdict": "not_useful", "key_issue": "Turn 4 broke context with garbled output mixing milk and auto parts"},
    "MX004": {"usefulness": 4, "verdict": "useful", "key_issue": "Turn 4 missing company names before 'Почему:' bullets"},
    "MX005": {"usefulness": 3, "verdict": "useful", "key_issue": "Turn 3 reverted to Brest suppliers after user shifted to Minsk"}
  }
}
```

**Critical findings:**
- **MX003** failed due to context breakdown in Turn 4 (garbled template output, mixed queries)
- **MX005** had continuity issues (reverting to Brest after user moved to Minsk)
- **MX001, MX002, MX004** performed well with minor formatting issues
