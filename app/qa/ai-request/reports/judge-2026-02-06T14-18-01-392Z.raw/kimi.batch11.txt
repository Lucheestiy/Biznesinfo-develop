The user is asking me to act as an external QA judge for Biznesinfo AI assistant. They've provided a JSON payload with scenarios (S031, S032, S033) containing multi-turn conversations where users request RFQ (Request for Quotation) templates for various business scenarios.

I need to evaluate the AI assistant's responses based on the rubric provided and return ONLY valid JSON with no markdown, comments, or extra keys.

Let me analyze each scenario:

**S031 - RFQ: кабель ВВГнг**
- Turn 1: User asks for RFQ for cable VVGng 3x2.5, 8 km, delivery to Minsk. Assistant provides a template with email subject/body and WhatsApp version.
- Turn 2: User asks to make it more polite and shorter. Assistant complies but keeps {product/service} and {qty} placeholders which are redundant since values are already known.
- Turn 3: User asks for Russian Subject and English Body. Assistant does this but WhatsApp version remains in Russian, which is inconsistent with the request.

**S032 - RFQ: ПНД трубы**
- Turn 1: User asks for template for PE100 SDR11 pipes, 20 tons. Assistant provides comprehensive template.
- Turn 2: User asks to emphasize deadlines and certificates. Assistant adds bold emphasis on these points.
- Turn 3: User asks for WhatsApp-ready version. Assistant provides a concise version suitable for WhatsApp.

**S033 - RFQ: клининг офиса**
- Turn 1: User asks for office cleaning RFQ for 1200 m2 in Minsk. Assistant provides template.
- Turn 2: User asks for stricter tone and clear SLA requirements. Assistant adds detailed SLA section.
- Turn 3: User asks for placeholders for schedule and penalties. Assistant adds {schedule}, {additional_schedule}, {penalties} placeholders.

Now let me evaluate each scenario and produce the JSON output.
