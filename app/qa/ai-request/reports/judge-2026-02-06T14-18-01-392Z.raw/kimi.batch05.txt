Based on my analysis of the conversation transcripts and understanding of the Biznesinfo AI assistant's purpose (business sourcing/search platform), here is my evaluation:

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "S013",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Assistant acknowledges location change but provides no actual company results",
        "Turn 3: Instead of providing top-3 candidates, asks user to find them first - defeats purpose",
        "No actionable shortlist delivered despite explicit user request"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Refusal to provide ranking without user doing the search work first",
        "No actual company data returned in any turn"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identifies rubric and keywords for search",
        "Properly acknowledges geo change from Borisov to Lyadishche"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S014",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasons": [
        "Only finds 1 irrelevant company (industrial equipment, not coffee)",
        "Turn 3 shortlist has just 1 non-coffee candidate with disclaimer",
        "Provides generic checklists instead of actual supplier data"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Failed to find actual coffee suppliers in Brest",
        "Shortlist contains zero relevant HoReCa coffee suppliers"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Good questions about roasting and logistics",
        "Correctly interprets 'center' as city center location"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S015",
      "usefulness": 1,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Lists 4 completely irrelevant companies (construction/design, not bearings)",
        "Turn 3: Ranks non-suppliers by 'reliability' - meaningless exercise",
        "Wastes user time with fake rankings of wrong companies"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "All 4 companies in initial response are wrong category",
        "Top-3 ranking is of construction companies, not bearing suppliers",
        "No acknowledgment that search failed to find bearing suppliers"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly acknowledges 18th microdistrict location"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```
