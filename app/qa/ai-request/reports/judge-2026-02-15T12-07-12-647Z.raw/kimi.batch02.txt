I see there's already a completed evaluation file. However, looking at the user prompt, they want me to evaluate the **current** transcript content provided in the prompt, which appears to be different from the previously evaluated content. Let me analyze the actual transcript content provided in the current prompt and provide fresh ratings.

Looking at the provided scenarios in the prompt, I can see the actual assistant responses are quite different from what was previously evaluated - there are significant issues with garbled text, template failures, and irrelevant results. Let me provide a fresh evaluation based on the actual content in the prompt:
