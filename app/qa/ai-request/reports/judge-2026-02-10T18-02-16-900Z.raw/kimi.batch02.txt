I've updated the evaluation file `qa_judge_uv006_010.json` with corrected ratings based on the actual transcript content provided in the prompt. Here are the key changes made:

**UV006**: Reduced from 5 to 4 (truncated response in Turn 3), fixed the nextUserProbe to reference actual companies from transcript.

**UV007**: Upgraded from 2 to 3 (changed to "useful") - while only 2 real companies were provided, the assistant honestly didn't invent companies and the cold email template was good quality.

**UV008**: Unchanged (2, not_useful) - correctly identified as generic fallback with no concrete companies.

**UV009**: Reduced from 4 to... kept at 4 but lowered confidence and satisfaction - Turn 4 doesn't actually include specific dental clinics from the catalog as previously claimed.

**UV010**: Unchanged at 4 (useful) - removed incorrect references to "Санта Бремор" and "Агрокомбинат Заря" that weren't in the transcript.
