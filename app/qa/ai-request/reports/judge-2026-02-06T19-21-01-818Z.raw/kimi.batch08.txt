Based on my analysis of the provided conversation transcripts, I need to evaluate the AI assistant's replies for usefulness. Let me analyze each scenario:

**S036 - RFQ: спецодежда (Workwear RFQ)**
- Turn 1: Good template with Subject/Body/WhatsApp sections, placeholders for specs
- Turn 2: **Critical issue** - The response is broken/malformed. It says "Subject: Запрос по уточни требования" which is garbled, and the body is nonsensical ("Нам нужно уточни требования в {city}"). The placeholders don't make sense for the request.
- Turn 3: Good friendly variant with proper structure

**S037 - RFQ: паллеты (Pallets RFQ)**
- Turn 1: Good template with proper structure
- Turn 2: Successfully added wood quality and moisture questions
- Turn 3: Good RU/EN mixed variant for international suppliers (though truncated in the WhatsApp part)

**S038 - RFQ: автозапчасти (Auto parts RFQ)**
- Turn 1: Good template, though "сто шаблон" seems like a placeholder artifact
- Turn 2: Successfully added defect return conditions and delivery terms
- Turn 3: Good long-term contract variant with proper emphasis

**S039 - RFQ: аренда автовышки (Aerial lift rental)**
- Turn 1: Good comprehensive template
- Turn 2: Successfully added insurance and operator qualification requirements
- Turn 3: WhatsApp variant is truncated ("WhatsApp: Нужна автовышка на 2 недели...") - missing the complete message

**S040 - RFQ: ремонт станков (CNC repair)**
- Turn 1: Good template with proper structure
- Turn 2: Successfully added SLA, spare parts, and engineer dispatch requirements
- Turn 3: Good urgent request variant with deadline emphasis
