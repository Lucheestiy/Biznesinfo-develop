  "executiveSummary": "UV017 passed all checks with 4/5 usefulness. The core issue is low-confidence supplier (БелМолдКом) included with 'условно релевантен' flag. While assistant honesty mitigates this, the pattern indicates retrieval returns companies with insufficient evidence. Recommend adding explicit confidence scoring and retrieval filtering for low-info cards to improve shortlist quality from conditional to high-confidence matches.",
  "priorityPlan": [
    {
      "priority": "P0",
      "title": "Add explicit confidence scoring to shortlist output",
      "why": "Both judges flagged БелМолдКом as 'conditionally relevant' - current 'условно релевантен' disclaimer is insufficient. Need explicit signals (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW confidence) so users immediately know which suppliers to prioritize.",
      "expectedImpact": "Expected usefulness score improvement from 4→4.5 by eliminating ' условно релевантен' ambiguity. Judges explicitly cited this as critical issue.",
