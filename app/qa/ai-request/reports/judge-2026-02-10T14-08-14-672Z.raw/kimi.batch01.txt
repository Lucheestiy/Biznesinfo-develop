### Key Findings:

1. **UV001**: Generic fallback after user clarification — assistant provided search instructions instead of concrete manufacturers
2. **UV002**: Critical relevance failure — shortlist contained cement plant and brewery instead of flour mills
3. **UV003**: Only "useful" scenario — handled consumer→B2B transition well, but shortlist was irrelevant
4. **UV004**: Complete disconnect — shortlist had tire factory and asphalt instead of juicer manufacturers
5. **UV005**: Underfilled shortlist — only 1 of 5 positions had a company (research institute, not manufacturer)

### Common Critical Issues:
- **Generic fallback** after user provides concrete constraints
- **Irrelevant shortlists** with completely wrong company types
- **No actionable contacts** for users to actually reach out to
