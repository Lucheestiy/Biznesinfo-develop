      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Generic search instructions instead of actual supplier suggestions — user asked for suppliers, got search keywords",
        "Turn 3: Failed to deliver promised top-3 ranking — admitted zero relevant candidates found, making the response non-actionable"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3 completely fails the user's explicit request for top-3 by reliability/availability — provides empty template instead",

        "Geo context (Шабаны) acknowledged but not utilized to find specific suppliers"

      "strengths": [
        "Honest about data limitations in turn 3 (non-hallucination)",
        "Maintained context continuity across turns",
