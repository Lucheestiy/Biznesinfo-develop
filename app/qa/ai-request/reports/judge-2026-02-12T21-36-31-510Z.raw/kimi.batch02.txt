**Key findings:**
- All scenarios scored below the useful threshold (3)
- Common critical issues: generic fallback behavior, providing irrelevant companies, loss of conversation context
- S008 was the worst (0/5) - ranked a cafe, road construction company, and bath house for a stainless steel sheet request
- S010 had the best start (5 concrete print shops in Turn 1) but completely lost context in Turn 3
- All scenarios exhibited `feltGenericFallback: true` - the assistant dropped to generic advice instead of making concrete progress
