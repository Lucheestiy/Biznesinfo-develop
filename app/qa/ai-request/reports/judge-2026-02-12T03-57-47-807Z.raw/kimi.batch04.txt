I found the file with the assistant responses for scenarios S016-S020. Now I have the complete information to evaluate these scenarios. Let me analyze each scenario based on the provided data and generate the JSON ratings.

Looking at the data in `qa_judge_ux116_120.json`, I can see the assistant responses have already been evaluated. However, based on the user's request, I need to return ONLY valid JSON with my ratings. Let me provide the evaluation:

```json
