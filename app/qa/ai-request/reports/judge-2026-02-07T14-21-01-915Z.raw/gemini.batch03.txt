        "Relevance to user intent: Accurately identifies and lists suppliers based on initial request for 'dairy packaging' and 'label printing' in Vitebsk.",
        "Geo adherence and context continuity: Correctly interprets 'Билево' as a district in Vitebsk and explains limitations regarding sub-location data, offering to refine.",
        "Actionability and concrete next steps: Provides actionable supplier links and asks relevant clarifying questions to narrow down the search in Turn 1 and Turn 2. Delivers a highly practical checklist for pre-test batch verification in Turn 3.",
        "Non-hallucination and honesty about limits: Clearly states when only 2 suppliers are found instead of the requested 3, and explains why, offering a path to find more. This demonstrates transparency and avoids hallucination.",
        "Formatting quality: Presents information clearly with good formatting (lists, bolding, URLs, and a checklist)."
