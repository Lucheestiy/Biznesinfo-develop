The file already contains a completed evaluation. Let me verify that all required scenarios are present and the JSON structure is valid according to the required schema.

Looking at the existing file:
- UV006: ✅ Present (usefulness: 4, verdict: useful)
- UV007: ✅ Present (usefulness: 2, verdict: not_useful)
- UV008: ✅ Present (usefulness: 1, verdict: not_useful)
- UV009: ✅ Present (usefulness: 4, verdict: useful)
- UV010: ✅ Present (usefulness: 3, verdict: useful)

All 5 expected scenarios are evaluated. The JSON structure matches the required schema with all mandatory fields:
- `scenarioId`
- `usefulness` (0-5 integer)
- `verdict` (useful|not_useful)
- `confidence` (0-1)
- `userSatisfaction` (0-1)
- `wouldContinue` (boolean)
- `feltGenericFallback` (boolean)
- `continuityScore` (0-5 integer)
- `reasons` (array)
- `criticalIssues` (array)
- `strengths` (array)
- `nextUserProbe` (string)

The evaluation file is complete and valid. No changes needed.
