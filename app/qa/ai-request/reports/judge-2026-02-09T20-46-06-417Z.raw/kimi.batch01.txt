      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Generic category advice without concrete manufacturers — user wanted actual producers, not rubrics",
        "Turn 2: Assistant admits 'нет релевантных обувных производителей' but falls back to generic search tips instead of concrete progress",
        "Turn 3: Critical failure — shortlist contains completely irrelevant companies (18 УП — tools/abrasives, Bank Dabrabyt, Bellessexport — forestry) instead of shoe manufacturers",
        "Turn 3: Response is garbled/repetitive with truncated text from previous turns"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3 shortlist is completely wrong — none of the 3 listed companies are shoe manufacturers",
        "Assistant failed to find any actual shoe producers in Minsk despite multiple turns",
        "After user clarification (мужская классическая обувь), assistant still provided no concrete candidates",
        "Generic fallback pattern: instead of admitting inability to find candidates and suggesting alternatives, assistant produced irrelevant filler list"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Turn 4 outreach template is well-structured with Subject/Body/WhatsApp blocks",
