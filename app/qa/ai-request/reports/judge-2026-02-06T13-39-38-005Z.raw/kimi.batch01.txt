Based on my evaluation of the 5 scenarios from the perspective of a user seeking business suppliers, here is my judgment:

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "S001",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Assistant repeatedly offers only one company (ArmaArtInvest) across all turns",
        "Turn 3 ranking is broken - lists 'Candidate #2' and 'Candidate #3' as 'requires selection' instead of actual companies"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Failed to provide actual top-3 list when explicitly requested",
        "No geo-filtering for Sukharevo district despite user specifying it twice",
        "Generic filler about search categories instead of concrete suppliers"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Asks clarifying questions about pipe specifications"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S002",
      "usefulness": 4,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasons": [
        "Provided 4 relevant electrical suppliers in Gomel with specific profiles",
        "Turn 3 gave concrete certificate checklist for VVGng cable"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "No actual geo-filtering for Soviet district - just mentions it without verifying supplier locations"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Good actionable list of electrical suppliers",
        "Useful certification checklist for cable procurement"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S003",
      "usefulness": 1,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.9,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1 correctly identified 2 concrete suppliers (Arcosgroup, ELEDI)",
        "Turn 3 completely broke - ranked agricultural machinery parts suppliers for concrete request"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Critical hallucination in turn 3: ranked Promis Alliance, Tefida, Agromashresurs (all agricultural parts) for concrete supply",
        "Self-aware of irrelevance but still presented useless ranking",
        "Lost context from turns 1-2 about actual concrete suppliers"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Initial turn had correct supplier identification"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S004",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1 only gave search categories, no actual companies",
        "Turn 3 refused to provide top-3 companies, gave generic priority criteria instead"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Never provided actual company names despite 3 turns",
        "Asked user to 'send list of found cards' - circular dependency",
        "Complete failure to fulfill 'top-3' request"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Correctly identified relevant search category"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S005",
      "usefulness": 3,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "reasons": [
        "Provided 4 auto service candidates with reasoning",
        "Turn 3 gave actionable priority order for calling"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "No companies explicitly confirmed to do tire service - all marked 'need to verify'",
        "No geo-filtering for Kamennaya Gorka district",
        "Candidates are generic auto services, not specialized tire shops"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Clear ranking with call priority",
        "Acknowledged uncertainty transparently"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
