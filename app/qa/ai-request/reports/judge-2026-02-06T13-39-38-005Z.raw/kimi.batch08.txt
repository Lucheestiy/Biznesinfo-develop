Now I understand the context. The user is asking me to act as an external QA judge to rate the usefulness of AI assistant replies in realistic multi-turn business sourcing conversations. They've provided 5 scenarios (S036-S040) with 3 turns each, and I need to evaluate them according to the rubric provided.

Let me analyze each scenario based on the rubric:

1. **S036 - RFQ: спецодежда** (Workwear RFQ)
2. **S037 - RFQ: паллеты** (Pallets RFQ)
3. **S038 - RFQ: автозапчасти** (Auto parts RFQ)
4. **S039 - RFQ: аренда автовышки** (Aerial lift rental RFQ)
5. **S040 - RFQ: ремонт станков** (CNC machine repair RFQ)

I'll evaluate each based on:
- Relevance to user intent
- Geo adherence and context continuity
- Actionability and concrete next steps
- Non-hallucination and honesty about limits
- Formatting quality for requested mode (ranking/template/checklist)
