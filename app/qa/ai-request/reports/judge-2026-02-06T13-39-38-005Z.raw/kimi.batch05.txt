Based on the QA evaluation request, I'll evaluate the 5 scenarios (S021-S025) for the Biznesinfo AI assistant. Let me analyze each scenario's multi-turn conversation and provide ratings according to the rubric.

```json
{
  "judge": "kimi",
  "ratings": [
    {
      "scenarioId": "S021",
      "usefulness": 3,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.75,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Instead of providing actual top-3 СТО, assistant gives generic criteria - user asked for ranking, got methodology",
        "Turn 2: Good explanation of criteria, maintains context (Брест), provides actionable framework",
        "Turn 3: Excellent practical checklist with 5 specific phone questions, highly actionable"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 1 fails to deliver requested ranking - no actual companies provided despite user explicitly asking for топ-3"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Maintains geo context (Брест) throughout",
        "Turn 3 provides concrete, actionable phone script",
        "Honest about data limitations but still provides value"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S022",
      "usefulness": 1,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Generic advice without specific companies, asks clarifying questions but doesn't provide ranking",
        "Turn 2: Critical failure - lists completely irrelevant companies (аудит, консалтинг, страхование) as 'топ' for шиномонтаж",
        "Turn 3: Good checklist but repeats generic ranking framework from other scenarios"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 2 is hallucination-level error: Balagol, Deloitte, СтрахЭкспертГрупп are NOT tire services - this is misleading and potentially harmful",
        "No relevant companies found yet still presents a 'топ-3' with false justification"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Turn 3 checklist is practical and relevant",
        "Maintains Минск context"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S023",
      "usefulness": 4,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Provides relevant search strategy with specific rubric and keywords for Гродно cleaning services",
        "Turn 2: Clear explanation of selection criteria, maintains context, offers to apply criteria to specific companies",
        "Turn 3: Comprehensive 10-point contract checklist, highly practical for BЦ manager"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [],
      "strengths": [
        "Strong geo adherence (Гродно)",
        "Actionable search guidance with specific catalog paths",
        "Excellent contract checklist covering SLA, personnel, materials, confidentiality",
        "Appropriate for target persona (BЦ manager)"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S024",
      "usefulness": 4,
      "verdict": "useful",
      "confidence": 0.82,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Honest about data limitations, provides clear search strategy with specific rubrics and keywords",
        "Turn 2: Transparent ranking framework (A/B/C tiers) with clear criteria, honest disclaimer about lack of data",
        "Turn 3: Comprehensive document checklist for outsourcing engagement"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [],
      "strengths": [
        "Honest about limitations - doesn't hallucinate companies",
        "Provides actionable search guidance",
        "Clear tiered evaluation framework",
        "Relevant document checklist for финансовый менеджер"
      ]
    },
    {
      "scenarioId": "S025",
      "usefulness": 2,
      "verdict": "not_useful",
      "confidence": 0.8,
      "reasons": [
        "Turn 1: Generic advice without specific carriers, asks clarifying questions appropriately",
        "Turn 2: Critical failure - lists construction/security/glass companies as 'топ-3 refrigerated carriers' in Гомеле",
        "Turn 3: Good SLA checklist but doesn't compensate for Turn 2 failure"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 2 is severe hallucination: Гомельремстрой (construction), Техспецэлектро (security), Гомельстекло (glass) are NOT refrigerated transport companies",
        "Presenting these as 'топ-3' with fabricated 'причина попадания' is misleading",
        "FMCG logistics professional would be seriously misled by this ranking"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Turn 3 SLA checklist is industry-appropriate for refrigerated transport",
        "Maintains Гомель context"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
