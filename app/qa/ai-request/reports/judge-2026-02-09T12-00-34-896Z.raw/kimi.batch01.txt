        "Turn 1: Provided 2 concrete milk suppliers in Brest with direct links and contacts",
        "Turn 2: Correctly pivoted to Minsk suppliers when user clarified, gave 3 candidates with contacts",
        "Turn 3: Honestly acknowledged lack of candidates specifically in Minsk region (not city), maintained context",
        "Turn 4: Delivered top-3 shortlist with clear reasoning as requested",
        "Turn 5: Provided ready-to-use RFQ template in email/WhatsApp format with placeholders"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Slight fallback to generic advice about searching catalog when no Minsk region candidates found",
        "Turn 4: Included Minsk city candidates in 'Minsk region' shortlist despite user explicitly excluding city"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent continuity across 5 turns: maintained milk, volume (1000L/week), Brest/Minsk context",
        "Honest about data limitations instead of hallucinating companies",
        "RFQ template is practical and complete with all necessary fields",
        "Each response adapted to user's specific format requests (shortlist, reasons, RFQ)"

        "Turn 5: Delivered 6-point call checklist as requested"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Response is garbled/incomplete — missing actual Brest candidate name and link",
        "Turn 4: Generic ranking without proper context — candidates don't match user's constraints (ТЕРСЕТ-ВЕСТ is in Brest but not clearly onion-focused)",
        "Turn 4: Ranking appears to be auto-generated template with wrong focus (mentions 'brest' for all 3 including Minsk region candidate)",
        "Turn 5: Response mixes new checklist with repetition of old ranking — confusing formatting"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Good geo-adherence: correctly distinguished Minsk city vs Minsk region",
        "Call checklist in Turn 5 covers practical procurement questions (price, logistics, docs)",

        "Turn 3: Successfully returned to milk/Brest context, recalled previous candidates",
        "Turn 5: Asked 2 precise clarifying questions instead of generic fallback when data insufficient"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 4: Honest about having only 2 confirmed candidates instead of 3, but response format is garbled with template artifacts",
        "Turn 4: Included confusing text about 'фокус: автозапчасти' when user already returned to milk topic"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Excellent topic switch handling: correctly followed user from milk -> auto parts -> back to milk",

      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Complete failure — responded with instructions about adding a company to catalog instead of providing top-3 cable suppliers",
        "Turn 4: Repeated same completely wrong response about adding company, ignoring 48-hour delivery constraint entirely",
        "Critical continuity break: Turns 3-4 completely lost the cable sourcing context, gave irrelevant generic instructions",
        "Turn 3-4 responses appear to be template hallucinations or system errors — completely off-topic"
      ],
      "strengths": [

      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "Turn 3: Failed to deliver 'who to call first' — response is garbled with template artifacts, missing actual candidate names in ranking",
        "Turn 3: Lost continuity — mentioned Brest candidates when user specifically asked about Minsk after criticizing lack of specifics",
        "Turn 3 response appears broken: 'Карточка: — /company/savushkin (Брест, brest)' without company name",
        "Did not indicate which of the 3 Minsk suppliers to call first based on volume/urgency criteria"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Good recovery in Turn 2 after user criticism — provided specific Minsk candidates as requested",
