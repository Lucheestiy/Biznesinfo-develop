QA ratings complete for scenarios UV011-UV015:

**Summary:**
- **UV011**: Rating 1 - Failed to deliver promised alternatives, repeated irrelevant companies (building materials factory, grocery store) after user clarification
- **UV012**: Rating 0 - Complete deflection across 3 turns, never performed website checks as requested
- **UV013**: Rating 0 - Same deflection pattern as UV012, no actual website verification work
- **UV014**: Rating 1 - Violated "without general advice" constraint in turn 3, fell back to generic sorting criteria
- **UV015**: Rating 3 - Only scenario that delivered requested format (1 query + 1 call script) in final turn

Key issues: UV012-UV013 have complete task failure (asking users to provide company lists). UV011/UV014 have critical generic fallback after user constraints. UV015 is the only working scenario with actionable output despite missing company data.
