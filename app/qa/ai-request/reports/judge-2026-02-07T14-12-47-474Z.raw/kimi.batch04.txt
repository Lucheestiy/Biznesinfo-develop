        "Turn 1: Generic category advice instead of concrete suppliers — user asked for suppliers, got search tips",
        "Turn 3: Failed to provide requested top-3 ranking — only gave criteria for ranking instead of actual suppliers"
      ],
      "criticalIssues": [
        "No actual supplier names provided across all 3 turns despite specific location (Minsk → Shabany)",
        "Turn 3 refusal disguised as 'methodology' — user explicitly asked for top-3 ranking, got ranking criteria instead"
      ],
      "strengths": [
        "Maintained context continuity correctly (understood Shabany as Minsk district)",
        "Correctly identified product specs (AISI 304, formats, surface types)"
